#+TITLE: Choir Book

We are currently developing a choir book for use at our parish, but we
have only recently started.

*Why use our own book and not simply buy another?* First, we are a
group of people with varying musical abilities who are trying to grow
together as an ensemble and as individual singers and chanters.  So,
we have decided to embrace our idiosyncracies and use our own
resources -- really most are our original renderings, not our
compositions -- and we choose them to fit our particular needs.

Here is (so far) the only resource we have developed.  It's basically
a proof-of-concept of our usage of the [[http://lilypond.org/][lilypond software]].
