#+TITLE: About

Welcome to our humble website.

We are chanters and members of the choir at [[http://www.holytrinity.in.goarch.org/][Holy Trinity Greek
Orthodox Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana]].

On this site, we are storing some resources that help us to chant and
sing our services.  Please use these resources freely, if you feel
that they can be of use to you also.
